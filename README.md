# Project Name
This is the code for the Bluetooth enabled Arduino uno. This code is a frame work in which servo functions are dropped into and then triggered using the MIT app inventor app. All PWM pins are used, and TX (1) RX (0) will be used for the serial data for the HC-05/06 bluetooth module.

## Branches

No branches

## Dependencies

What do you need to get this code to do what the description says?

### Hardware

Arduino uno R3, SparkFun BlueSMiRF, Android nexus 7 Tablet

### Software

List each software dependency including version number. Include preferred IDEs, link to related third-party libraries, other TechHive code.

## Setup

How do you set up the stuff from the above section? E.g. how do you install the software, does the software run on your local machine (your personal computer) or the microprocessor? How do you connect the hardware? How do you build the code? How do you load it into the hardware? Itâ€™s also fine to link to other documentation here instead of retyping everything, e.g. link to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno if you expect people to use the IDE for the development process.

## Tests / Usage

How do you know that the setup worked (e.g. should there be certain LEDs on? Should there be certain output printed through the serial port?)? Are there tests that should pass? If you press a certain button should something happen?

## Contact

Who is the main person/people who maintains this repo? What is the best way to contact them (email them? Create a GitHub issue?)
